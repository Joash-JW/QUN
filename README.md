### Description of Project
This project is for Queen's University CISC/CMPE 327 CISC/CMPE 327 Software Quality Assurance for Fall 2019 Semester. In this project, we are to design and implement Quinterac (Queen's Old-Fashioned Interactive Banking System) in a team, following the **eXtreme Programming** philosophy. For this project, we implemented Quinterac using **Java** and **Maven** for testing.
